  Social sustainability is key proponent of wellbeing created by software. However, creating the requirements for building social sustainability into software is not an easy task. Using equality as the main socials sustainability aspect, a process of requirements elicitation is shown. Equality is here defined as the right for all participants in society to access (public) resources with discrimination of any kind. Value sensitive designs exist, but are mostly unused in everyday software development. The authors generate an initial equality value pattern. They showcase the Goal, its Dimension and associated values, and the regulations and activities that have an impact on theses values.
